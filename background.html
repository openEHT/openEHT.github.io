	    <h1>EHT Background</h1>

	    <p>
		In fall 2017, a <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/10/12/25468311/city-council-members-want-to-bring-back-the-employee-head-tax">proposal was put forward</A> by Councilmember Mike O'Brien and interim Councilmember Kirsten Harris-Talley to impose an "Employee Hours Tax" on large businesses to fund new housing, shelter, and services.  
		Although the measure fell in a 5-4 vote, on November 20th the council unanimously passed Resolution 31782.  
		This resolution expressed the council's intention to find new progressive revenues including an Employee Hours Tax, and to pass legislation in spring 2018 to "make investments with these revenues that would assist people who are homeless or at a high risk of becoming homeless in obtaining and retaining stable housing."

	    <h2>Progressive Revenue Task Force</h2>

	    <p>
		The City Council created a Progressive Revenue Task Force to study the issues and make recommendations.  
		Chaired by Councilmembers Lisa Herbold and Lorena Gonz√°lez, the Task Force included representatives of several organizations in Housing For All, as well as other advocates, experts, and business owners.  
		After many meetings the Task Force unanimously recommended an Employee Hours Tax to raise $75 million per year, the top of the range they were asked to consider.  
		They recommended that 80% of the funding be used for housing and 20% for shelter and services, and that the tax be structured as equitably as possible so that very large businesses like Amazon - the ones that are benefitting most from our region's growth and can most afford it - will contribute most.
